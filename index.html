        <h2>Meet Rhys, sailor turned techie.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          With ten incredible years in the Royal New Zealand Navy, Rhys ascended
          to the esteemed rank of Petty Officer as a Propulsion Engineer. His
          skills were recognized, he topped his leadership courses while also
          being awarded the distinction of Sailor of the Quarter. The capstone
          of his naval career? Serving as an instructor for the Marine
          Engineering School, mentoring the next wave of talent. <br /><br />

          Eager to explore new horizons, Rhys then leaped into the world of tech
          startups. As a non-technical founder, he navigated the tech seas,
          leading a team of contract developers in an agile environment. His
          startup quickly gained traction, attracting 5000 users and an advisory
          board member from Xero's founding team! <br /><br />

          Rhys's tech journey didn't stop there. He plunged into the world of
          coding, spending nine months as a junior Salesforce developer with an
          Auckland company - Sleeq. Working with Salesforce's proprietary
          languages, along with JavaScript and Python, Rhys became an
          indispensable asset to his team. <br />
          <br />

          Now, with approximately four years of experience as a self-employed
          contract mechanical engineer, Rhys stands at the intersection of
          engineering and tech. Armed with resilience, adaptability, and a
          relentless pursuit of growth, he's ready to conquer his next
          challenge. You're not just hiring a developer; you're bringing aboard
          a seasoned sailor, trained to weather any storm and keep the ship
          sailing smoothly. Discover what he is capable of below!

          <h3>Game On: Building Tech With Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Life isn't all fun and games, but why shouldn't it be? In 2017, I
            embarked on my biggest adventure yet and launched my first tech
            startup, noc noc. Not just another game in the arcade, noc noc
            became a platform connecting users to local businesses. And, just
            like an arcade game, the high score kept climbing, reaching 5000
            users and attracting a board advisor from Xero. Game on!

          <h3>Engineered For Success</h3>
          <p>
            If life is a machine, then I'm the mechanic, always ready with the
            right tool for the job. My decade-long journey with the RNZN saw me
            growing from a novice sailor to a qualified engineer and an
            instructor for the Marine Engineering School. I've tackled big
            challenges, solved complex problems, and engineered solutions that
            keep everything running smoothly, just like our little robot friend
            here. Mechanically minded, I'm prepared for any challenge the tech
            world throws at me.
